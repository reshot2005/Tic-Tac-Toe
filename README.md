# Tic-Tac-Toe [PLAY GAME](https://tic-tac-toe-sigma-eight-81.vercel.app/)

Welcome to the **Cyberpunk Tic-Tac-Toe** game, a stylish and futuristic version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, set in a neon-lit cyberpunk universe. This project features both a **two-player mode** and an intelligent **bot opponent** that challenges you with smart moves in a Cyberpunk theme.

## Features 

  
### **Two-Player Mode**
- Play against a friend in the classic **two-player mode**, where each player takes turns marking their spots (X or O) on the grid.

### **Bot Opponent Mode**
- Play against a **smart AI bot** that calculates the best possible move for every turn, giving you a challenging experience.
  - **Intelligent AI Logic**: The bot uses a simple yet effective strategy to block your winning moves and attempt to win when possible.
  - **Randomization**: If no immediate winning or blocking move is available, the bot chooses a random open spot.

### **Game State and UI**
- The game displays the current player's turn (X or O).
- **Winner Announcement**: The winner (either Player X or Player O) is displayed when someone wins, along with a visual highlight of the winning combination.
- **Tie Condition**: If the game ends with no winner and the board is full, a tie is announced.
- **Reset Button**: A "New Game" button allows players to reset the game and start fresh.
- **Go Back Button**: Return to the homepage with a "Go Back" button.
  
### **Responsive Design**
